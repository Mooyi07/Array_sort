# Array Sorting Program

## 📌 Description
This Java program takes an array of numbers as input and sorts them in ascending order using a basic **Bubble Sort** algorithm. Users specify the number of elements in the array and input their values, which are then sorted and displayed.

## 🛠 Features
- Accepts user input for the number of elements.
- Reads multiple integers from the user.
- Displays the original array before sorting.
- Sorts the array in **ascending order** (modifiable for descending order).
- Prints the sorted array.

## 📂 File Structure
- `Array_Sort.java` – Contains the implementation for sorting an array.

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```sh
   javac Array_Sort.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   java Array_Sort
   ```
3. **Enter the number of elements and the array values:**
   ```
   Enter number of arrays: 5
   Input 5 number/s:
   8 3 7 1 9
   ```
4. **Example Output:**
   ```
   Original Array: 8, 3, 7, 1, 9
   Sorted Array: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
   ```

## 📝 Explanation
1. The program prompts the user to input the size of the array.
2. It then collects integer values into an array.
3. The **Bubble Sort** algorithm is used to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
4. The sorted array is displayed as output.
5. To switch to **descending order**, simply change the comparison operator (`>` to `<`) in the sorting loop.
